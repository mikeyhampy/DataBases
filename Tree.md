Trees are similar to linked lists. They point to other nodes in the datastructure. However, trees can point to multiple nodes. For now, we're just going to focus on binary trees and binary search trees.

# Binary Tree

Binary trees is a tree that links to no more than two nodes. The node the is at the top is called the root. Nodes that connect to no other nodes are called leaf nodes. A node that has connected nodes is called a parent node. The node connected to the parent are called child nodes. The nodes to the left and right of any parent node form a subtree. See Figure below.
